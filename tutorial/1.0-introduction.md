# Welcome to Programming Lightning: Gossip Network & Routing Payments

Welcome to Programming Lightning: Gossip Network & Routing Payments! In this course, we'll dive deep into the Lightning Network's gossip protocol and learn how nodes create authenticated connections with each other and leverage onion routing to privately and securely route payments across the Lightning network. If you're interested in learning how Lightning payment channels work and implementing one from scratch, check out the first module of Programming Lightning: [Intro to Payment Channels](https://replit.com/@austin-f/Programming-Lightning-Intro-to-Payment-Channels).

# Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have a working understanding of Bitcoin transactions, script, and Lightning payment channels. If you'd like to brush up beforehand, here are a few excellent resources:
- Script (Free): https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/script/
- Transactions (Free): https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction/

# Replit

While Programming Lightning is open source and can be completed locally on your machine, it's likely easiest to complete the course on Replit. Once you fork (aka "Remix") the **Programming Lightning: Gossip Network & Routing Payments** Repl, you'll be able to open the course. It's recommended to use a **2-pane setup** with the **Tutorial** on one side and the following tabs on the other side:
- `src/exercises/transactions.txt`
- Replit Shell
- Replit Console

**This is what that would look like**:

# Course Exercises

As you work through the course, you will come across emojis that signal an exercise is coming up.  Here's a quick overview of what you will see and what each emoji means:

### Command Line Exercises

👉 This emoji means the following console command should be copied and pasted into your **Shell**:
```
// some command or code will be here, with a copy button on the right ->
```

### Coding Exercises
⚡️ You'll see a lightning bolt when it's time to start a programming exercise. All programming exercises in this course will have the following two types of dropdowns, which you can use to help you complete each exercise.
1. **💡 Hint 💡**: Provides useful tips and direction to help you complete the exercises, but it does not provide the full answer itself.
2. **Step-By-Step Instructions**: Provides detailed directions for how to complete the exercise.
