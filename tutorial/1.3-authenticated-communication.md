# Encrypted + Authenticated Communication

Great, now that we've built our intuition around why the Lightning Network developers chose to *not* to use TLS, it's time to introduce the chosen solution, **The Noise Protocol**.

## Noise Protocol Framework

The Noise Protocol is a **secure channel** protocol, meaning that data tranmitted over this channel is resistant to outsiders eavesdropping and tampering with the content being transfered. If we were to map this definition onto Lightning, it means that, if Alice and Bob are communicating with each other, nobody else should be able to read the content of their messages or change the content itself. It's easy to see why this is crucial for a payment protocol. First, payments are private information and nobody elses business! Second, if anyone could alter data messages in transit, they could easily change the amount of money being sent in any given transaction. That would be... bad!

It's also worth noting that Lightning is in good company when it comes to choosing the Noise Protocol. For instance, popular messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Slack also leverage the Noise Framework to add end-to-end encryption for their 3+ billion users!

Up next, we'll dig very deep into the Noise Protocol and even implement part of it ourselves! However, before doing that, let's introduce a few important security properties that the Noise Protocol will provide for Lightning.

### Mutual Authentication & Identity Hiding


### Encryption

### Forward Secrecy


The Noise Protocol is built around channel partners creating a **shared secret** - which is a piece of data that only the two partners know - by using Diffie–Hellman key exchange. This shared secret can then be used to achieve certain privacy nd security requirements, such as **mutual authentication**, **forward secrecy**, and **identity protection**. We'll review each of these in more detail shortly!
