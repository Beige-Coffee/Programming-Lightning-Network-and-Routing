# Authenticated Communcation

Great, we're working our way up the networking tech stack! 

At this point, we've reviewed the following foundations::
1) **Network Layer:**: Lightning nodes will leverage the Internet Protocol (IPv4, IPv6, or Tor) to provide an address to send and receive data from.
2) **Transport Layer**: To ensure reliable or ordered delivery of messages, nodes will use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
3) **Public Key**: Each Lightning node will have a public key, which can be used to sign protocol messages and provide a long-term identity.

So, what's missing? At this point, we still don't have a way to authenticate connections, encrypt data in transit, and ensure integrity (i.e., data is not altered in transit). To provide these features, Lightning uses the **Noise Protocol**.

To provide data integrity, encryption, and authentication, the Lightning Network uses
